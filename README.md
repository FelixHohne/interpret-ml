# interpret-ml

This project for Cornell Data Science implements Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models. 

Our three key datasets are: 
1. twitter_analysis.csv
2. civil_wars.RData
3. christian_nationalism.dta

R implementations of Poisson GLM and GAM are in the main directory. 

The core notebooks and implementation codes are in Final Notebooks: 
1. `gam_impl.jl`: Our implementation of GAMs in Julia
2. `glm_impl.jl`: Our implementation of GLMs in Julia
3. `glm_theory_and_practice.ipynb`: Julia Notebook with mathematics of GLMs, plus dataset analysis
4. `gam_theory_and_practice.ipynb`: Julia notebook with mathematics of GAMs, plus dataset analysis
5. `christian_nationalism.ipynb`: Codes to create visualizations for Christian Nationalism results
